			    <p>The story of Cars is set in an alternate universe where every character is a vehicle of various sorts, whether that be an automobile, an aircraft and a watercraft. The film focuses on a rookie race car named Lightning McQueen who discovers the lost town of Radiator Springs on his way to the biggest race of his life.</p>

			</div>
			<p>The film opens in the last race of the 2006 Piston Cup stock car racing season and championship in the
				Motor Speedway of the South, where a skilled but arrogant rookie racecar Lightning McQueen has overtaken
				his opponents, past a huge wreck, and has built up a huge lead over the cup's defending soon retiring
				seven-time champion Strip "The King" Weathers and perennial runner-up Chick Hicks. However, because of
				his refusal to make regular pit stops and get new tires, his rear worn tires burst into flames on the
				final lap, causing him to skid and ultimately crawl to the finish line, barely managing to tie the King
				and Chick Hicks in a photo finish by sticking his tongue out at the edge of the finish line. Race
				officials announce that because the three racers are also tied in overall season points they will
				compete in one final tiebreaker race to be held at the Los Angeles International Speedway in one week to
				determine the champion.</p>
		    <p>While traveling down Interstate 40 to California, Lightning becomes separated from Mack, his transport
				truck, and while trying to catch up becomes lost on U.S. Route 66, catching the attention of the local
				Radiator Springs Sheriff in the process. A chase ensues, during which Lightning crashes and gets tangled
				in wires, damaging part of the town's main street in the process.</p>

			<p>Lightning is taken to traffic court, where the town's attorney Sally Carrera pleads against Lightning.
				He is sentenced to repave the road using "Bessie", an asphalt-laying machine. Only interested in leaving
				and extremely furious, he makes an escape attempt before being hooked up, only to figure out his gas
				tank was siphoned. Lightning rushes through his first day of paving and the new road surface is so
				bumpy, unusable, uneven, and poor that he is told he must scrape it off and start over again.</p>

			<p>When Doc Hudson offers Lightning a deal beat Doc in a race around Willy's Butte and he is free to go,
				Lightning eagerly accepts. He leaves Doc in the dust at the starting line, but loses control on the
				loose dirt turn and crashes into a cactus patch. While the town's tow truck, Mater, hauls Lightning out
				of the cactus patch in which he landed, Doc effortlessly cruises to the finish line after informing
				Lightning that he races like he fixes roads. Lightning is compelled to scrape off the botched pavement
				and start over again. After Lightning completes a section of the road for the night, Mater asks if he
				would like to do something fun. He finds out that Mater was talking about a game called "Tractor
				Tipping." Lightning tries to back down but is convinced by Mater. Mater shows him how to tip a tractor.
				He sneaks up to one sleeping and suddenly blares his horn causing the tractor to react and tip over
				backward and fart (backfire). Lightning having a go approaches a tractor with Mater urging him to do it.
				Lightning then roars engine waking ever tractor in the field with all of them tipping over and farting
				all at once. They have a laughing moment, but suddenly awake Frank, a red combine harvester with the
				personality of a bull who chases them out of the field by threaten to grind them up with his blade.</p>

			<p>As the ensuing days pass, Lightning is disturbed by nightmares of Chick Hicks winning the Piston Cup and
				landing Dinoco. He starts to befriend the town's residents and learn more about the town in the process:
				how Radiator Springs was once a thriving town until completion of the nearby interstate bypassed the
				little town, depriving it of its business traffic and visitors and ironically, depriving those passing
				visitors of the natural beauty found in the scenery along the old highway, how Sally left behind her
				rich but unhappy life as an urban lawyer, what tractor tipping is, and how Doc Hudson was once a famous
				racecar himself the Hudson Hornet and 3-time Piston Cup champion -- until a horrible crash in 1954 ended
				his racing career.</p>

			<p>Doc bitterly refuses to reveal much about his past despite Lightning witnessing him expertly drifting
				through the loose dirt of Willy's Butte where Lightning crashed, labeling his old trophies as a bunch of
				empty cups.</p>

			<p>By the time Lightning finishes repaving Radiator Springs's main road, he has formed a bond with the town
				and its residents. Rather than immediately leaving for California as he had initially been eager to do,
				he spends the day touring the town's businesses, receiving a fresh coat of paint and new tires in the
				process, and participates in a cruise party that night. But he is suddenly found, then whisked away in
				his truck, Mack, without even a chance to bid farewell to Radiator Springs. The town's residents are sad
				to see him leave, and Sally is grumpy to learn that it was Doc who ultimately informed the media of
				Lightning's whereabouts.</p>

			<p>The final race among Lightning, the King, and Chick opens with what the race's commentators call the
				biggest race in history. Lightning is distracted by his memories of Radiator Springs, losing time to The
				King and Chick Hicks, and begins to fear he will simply lose. To his surprise, Doc Hudson has arrived at
				the race, with Mater and a few others from Radiator Springs who will serve as his pit crew, Doc, once
				again wearing his original Hudson Hornet racing stripes, takes over as Lightning's crew chief. With
				Doc's coaching, a record-fast pit stop for new tires, and a few tricks learned from the small town's
				inhabitants, Lightning is not only able to overtake his opponents, but has built a considerable lead by
				the final lap.</p>

			<p>As Lightning approaches the finish line, Chick sideswipes The King in a desperate attempt to avoid
				finishing behind him yet again, sending The King into a terrible rollover crash. Lightning, fearing that
				the King's racing career will end in the same way as did the Hudson Hornet's, comes to a full stop right
				before the finish line, choosing to accept loss. After Chick gleefully crosses the finish line and
				celebrates his victory, Lightning then backtracks to push the veteran racer across the finish line ahead
				of him, saying that "I think the king should finish his last race!" Although Chick Hicks has officially
				won his first Piston Cup title, he begins to learn that it's a hollow victory as he is jeered and
				despised by the fans and media for taking out the King, while McQueen is cheered as a hero for his good
				sportsmanship. Tex from Dinoco, The King's sponsor company, offers to support Lightning as his new
				sponsor, but Lightning, having now had a change of heart, respectfully declines, saying that his current
				sponsor Rust-eze gave him his, big break, and he wanted to continue with them.</p>

			<p>After the race, Lightning returns to Radiator Springs, announcing that he will establish his racing
				headquarters there. This helps to revitalize the town and draw back visitors and tourists, with the
				once-abandoned Route 66 being reclassified as Historic Route 66.</p>
